The model still required a big step of improvements to achieve higher accuracy. <br>

# To run the web application in local

<ol>
<li>Download or clone the git repository</li><br>
  
```
$ git clone https://github.com/EeYeoKeat/Machine_Learning_based_web_applications.git
```

<li>Change directory to the local repository folder</li><br>

```
$ cd D:\GitHub\Machine_Learning_based_web_applications\Text_Sentiment_Analysis_Web
```

###### Perform following action to set up environment and install Flask with the packages. If you have activated environment and installed Flask and the dependencies, you may skipped and continue from step 8 to run application directly. Remember to activate the environment.

<li>Create and manage environment</li><br>

```
$ env\Scripts\activate
```

After that, you will noticed that environment activation done when indicated by (env) at beginning. Example as below.

```
(env) PS D:\GitHub\Machine_Learning_based_web_applications\Text_Sentiment_Analysis_Web>
```

<li>Install Flask using pip</li><br>

```
$ pip install flask
```

<li>Install Numpy Pandas Scikit-learn libraries</li><br>

```
$ pip install numpy pandas sklearn
```

<li>Set environment variable</li><br>
